I always thought I was good at connecting with people, and key to my success was the fact that people love talking about themselves. Due to this phenomena, all I had to do to engage in a rich conversation with someone was to ask questions and feign interest.

In hindsight, connecting with people wasn't the right word for how I met people. In reality, I treated all new acquaintances as shooting range targets, firing round after round of desperation until the person in question felt enough pity that they were obligated to stay in a conversation with me.

Demanding answers and providing none in return backfired pretty quickly. When answering deep life questions get in the way of busy people doing actual things, they need a value prop to continue imparting wisdom. All people worth listening to are actively fighting their ignorance by seeking to hear what other people care about. When people began to probe me for thoughts the same way I did to them, I didn't have good answers. After all the time I spent suppressing my unpopular opinions and boring interests in the hopes of tricking people into thinking that we had enough in common to be friends, I couldn't articulate what I cared about. I found that they only people willing to speak with me were forced to or had nothing better to do.

It was heartbreaking to realize that my honest answer to the question of what I did in my spare time was homework, and even sadder when I started embellishing stories. I didn't know what I disliked about business student prior to becoming one, but I finally pinpointed their fake passion as the culprit. And there I was: The very pinnacle of empty interests.

I've given myself some concrete steps to take to develop the ability to talk about what I care about. First, I have to find things I care about. I used to think being interesting was a product of doing everything under the sun, but now I understand it's more important to find the few things you really care about and stick to them. I dropped a large number of extra curriculars and forced myself to spend more time on what I stayed with. I was so accustomed to fulfilling club duties an hour before club meetings, and then I would wonder why I didn't find a lot of value in what I was doing. This year, I've learned more from a few activities than I did when I was part of more clubs. 

Second, I need to be willing to speak about my hobbies. If people ask me what I've been up to, I might as well be vulnerable to judgement and tell them! I hate talking about the things I like doing because often it's just too much of a hassle to go into more detail than "I haven't done anything this year." Though untrue, this trickled into my psyche and after my first year I generally felt that I hadn't achieved anything. Telling others what I've done may feel like I'm bragging, but at the very least it will make my achievements feel more tangible. Talking to my mom over cyberspace doesn't seem to cut it. 

Next time you see me, feel free to help me tackle my biggest fears. Ask me what I'm interested in.
