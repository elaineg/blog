Allow me to begin by updating those ignorant of campus lingo (AKA me 48 hours ago): A "social" is the new term for "playdate at my place". To tweens, it's better known as "hanging out". YA linguistics is scientifically proven to be the fastest-evolving form of language.

Because university students now think they've reached the age where they're hip and old, the main attraction at a social is coming up with new creative ways to shove varying forms of flammable fluid down their throats. It's no joke. It's a grueling olympics made of skills that will never be applicable elsewhere, and having absolutely no shame. Tongue flip cup, anyone?

I never imagined that I'd ever be invited to one of these functions because firstly, I was a poor college student that couldn't afford admission tickets or to bmob (bring my own booze). More importantly, I have an aura which anyone that is either cool or holding party invites steers completely clear of. To give you an idea of the severity of this trait, I was the only one in my third grade class that wasn't invited to Alex B's birthday bowling party.

It goes without saying then, that the circumstances were a little different for this social. It was less of desperate freshmen trying to be worldly and get in on wine memes and more of an initiation event. I had interviewed and was hired to be a freshman executive for a school club, and this was a bonding night where we'd get a chance to meet our fellow club mates and co-chairs.

I had my misgivings about consuming alcohol at a large gathering of people that I spent the previous week trying to impress before I understood my relationship to it, but my fellow frosh weren't so conservative. As we walked out of university territory, past the student ghetto, and ventured for the first time into no-frosh's land that is ominously referred to as "past Princess Street", I listened to my classmates predict the how their night would end. "We are going to be absolutely hammered," One piped [in a non-British accent], eyes gleaming. "Did anyone bring a stomach pump?" Everyone seemed well aware that they weren't going to be proud of themselves. "I put my mom as my emergency contact," Another added. "Yeah, she lives in Toronto, but I figure that she'll be able to nag some sense into me if I can't get myself together." We practiced drinking games on our way there. "Point to the person most likely to wake up on someone else's couch on three. Winner takes the first shot."

As a serial play dumb-er, I was struck by how much people wanted to be free of inhibitions and sane thought. I used to joke that I was able to get drunk off air, but now it seemed to be more fact than fiction. Everyone seemed to be practicing how to be absolutely stupid. "Let's kidnap that dog and show him off at the party," One girl said, eying an undeserving passerby. "It's so cute." Everyone took at suggestion at face value.

One of the club's traditions dictated that should arrive at the event no earlier or later than 9:43PM, and we were to bring a single sock. We reached the house at 9:40 like the keeners we were, so we huddled together outside to fend off the cold. I broke the rules and brought two socks like the extra keener I was, and I wore them as mittens. It was a brilliant plan, and people told us so.

We were spotted by our co-chair not even a minute after. "Shh," We pleaded. "Don't tell the host. We're not supposed to be here and we're just camping out without him knowing until the time comes."

"Wow, camp out right in front of his house. That's a real great plan."

All my life I had been raised understanding that alcohol was the sin juice of the devil, the true reason behind Adam and Eve's banishment. If my life was a movie it would just be an extended film campaign of slippery slope arguments that paint alcohol as the cause of world hunger. In my mind, a bunch of little subtle occurrences had added up and created a titan. There was a drunk kid upending over my friend at a full-formal dance. The image of my normally reserved father puking his guts out at a bar. Uselessly babysitting a poor intoxicated girl as she rolled around in a muddy puddle giggling about cacti farms.

The first thing that struck me was how at ease everyone was around the hell-liquid. People laughed, danced, and had normal everyday conversations aroun it. I had always been a skeptic of house gatherings because in movies the house ends up completely egged over, the house plants end up in the toilet, and the protagonist gets in a lot of trouble. I didn't realize that in between all the wild parts, it's genuinely a good way to know the real someone. Drunk people will tell you their real aspirations, like their dream ice cream parlor or bagel bakery. They'll tell you about their lowest moments and their favourite achievements, ignoring their shame and/or need to be modest. If you're lucky, you can even get their social insurance numbers. Everyone forgot about the inescapable shackle of due dates, tuition payments, and high-stakes pressure that had chained itself to their ankles. Instead, a bag of cheap, vile wine was paraded around and people were asked to slap it as hard as they could, before bowing down on their knees and taking the longest possible swig. I was brought back to a time when I was hitting a pi√±ata at a birthday party years ago, and I realized that these wannabe adults really just wanted to be kids again.

I had vehemently preached the fruitlessness of trying to get to know people at a party before because no one would remember or care who you were the previous night. But regardless of my decision to leave my team hanging when they needed an extra member for flip cup, it was the first time I truly felt like I was part of a group at university. I don't share a lot in common with these high-achieving peers, but they took me in.

However, I'm in no hurry to do this all over again, and that's probably not the moral of the story that you were wishing for. As I passed out on my own safe little bed at 2:30AM, I knew that I was going to regret it in the morning. As a final parting note to my high and mighty past self: It's not the hangovers that people regret.

PS. We did not end up doing anything with the socks.
