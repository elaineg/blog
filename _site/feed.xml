        <title>Nobody likes orange</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know better than anyone that orange is a difficult to deal with because I stubbornly insist on its complete integration into my personal projects. I’ve had to acquaint myself with its shortcomings as a color and unfortunately, this process didn’t take very long. For one, it’s impossible to place the colour next to a black object without my blog looking like a satan apologist forum. Nobody likes the iconically awful Halloween colour combo. Nobody likes orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve struggled to like it my entire childhood. Orange is such an unwelcome intruder, the mom who wants to play truth or dare with you at a sleepover. You’ve never really considered it, and you don’t really want to. It’s got even less personality than yellow, which at least associates with happiness and sunshine, but has a poor public image anyway. The other day, I was considering the reasons why Team Instinct is the least popular Pokémon Go team by a landslide, and aside from the obvious reason that the name ‘Instinct’ is just an invitation to be bullied, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kissmetrics.com/gender-and-color/&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; overwhelmingly claims that yellow and orange are the dingiest, most disliked colours. I can’t help but notice they’re similar in tone, mood, and expression: Think the shoddy yellow packaged No Name brands, neon orange emergency kit bags, ugly emojis. These two colors are cheap, alarming, and fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was probably difficult to guess, but for some reason against my better judgement orange is how I identify as a person. By this admission, it’s probably not difficult to also guess which loser Pokémon team I’m on. It’s been a journey trying to figure out how this pitiful colour finds its place in a design sphere that is stacked so overwhelmingly against it. I hope this explains my affinity for the orange accents everywhere on the site, but if I’m lucky, you didn’t even notice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A hundred 'Hello World!'s and counting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s another one. Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I finally join the leagues of infant bloggers that have successfully figured out how to beam their computer hacker messages onto the internet after a dizzying number of attempts. My head feels light, but I’m sure this is entirely due to the alarming amount of hair I’ve lost out of frustration. I’ve put this blog here to hopefully convince my mom that I am capable of doing things with my time despite my front of lying on a couch mindlessly consuming trashy media and to write to undemanding, imaginary friends instead of opening my anxiety-inducing inboxes. It’s a perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been building this site, I’ve picked up on some bits of internet culture that remind me why so many flock to the extremely left-wing bubble society that is the internet to escape from real life. Once upon a time several years ago, I myself was an informed netizen and Tumblr memes were my religion. I gradually drifted from the clique, however, when I forgot my password. At the time, there were concepts that my young age prevented me from understanding so I thought people memed on Mitt Romney during his election cycle purely because he dropped a chicken wing at a barbecue one time. I see now the more pc reason for all the flak he got was because he was the current figurehead of capitalist values. He was the purveyor of the “irl” mentality that in order to be successful, you have to get paid for your work. That logic makes sense because humans need to eat to live, but like all the other rules it doesn’t seem to apply to the internet. Here, it’s the accepted norm to create things that people can use for free. Brilliant, busy people with lives to live instead dedicate their hours to make tools for others to use, and that’s why we have Wikipedia and Kim Kardashian. Essentially, I want to thank all the smart samaritans that live on the internet forums where I copied all the complicated computer things needed to say hello to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
