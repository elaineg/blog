Last year I was elected to represent the Commerce Society at the Queen's University Senate, which is one of the three governing bodies of the school. It is concerned with academic matters and issues that affect the "welfare" of the University. In addition, I get to be one of the 10 or so students (alongside Year Presidents, the President of the student government, and other elected members) that have voting power to pass or fail motions to amend policy. Policy dictates how the Commerce Society is run.

The first assembly of the 2017-2018 school year happened last Sunday and although I had attended Commerce Assembly before, the experience was vastly different when students were directing their presentations and reasons to change policy toward me. We didn't hear any highly contentious, controversial motions, but I still had to imagine the impact a policy change could have on students and this is what made the assembly much more engaging than last year.

At this assembly our Human Resources Officer had a number of edits to make to our Society's hiring policy, which is especially important at this time of year because all of the clubs governed by the Commerce Society are currently hiring first year students and they must abide by the policy we set forth. This policy has undergone massive changes just over the last year as our society experiments with what works and what requires too many resources. When I was doing interviews as a first year student, a member of the Commerce Society was required to sit in on ALL the interviews that took place. That's 60 students supervising interviews for 30 clubs with around 30 interviews each. This is done to ensure that decisions made from interviews are fair and not rooted in nepotism, but during my first year hiring interviews, I remembered that the majority them did not have a member of ComSoc Assembly sitting in. Given everyone's busy schedule, it wasn't feasible.

The policy is now being amended to allow clubs more autonomy in the hiring process- A member of assembly will not sit in on interviews. Clubs (committees, as we call them) will be monitored as complaints arise and the Human Resources portfolio assures that they will be reviewing interview notes. For the first time, there are tangible punitive measures that are being implemented in policy, namely a hiring probation where a club will have their interviews tightly monitored by Assembly again.

There are a number of arguments against this approach from all constituents, but this is how I reasoned those concerns.

### Effect on Committees

For the most part, this is great. I believe the majority of co-chairs want to build a team of the most passionate and driven people they can find, which is in line with the Commerce Society's hope for hiring. I understand and agree that the loose term "fit" is incredibly important for hiring a candidate that will make the most of their experience on a club, but because it is difficult to define, it is difficult to monitor when it is being abused. However, the case to hire can be made for each and every single one of the similarly qualified students and I don't think an Assembly representative will actually influence a decision. Implementing punitive measures to deter complaints is a better way to address the consequences arising from a poor hiring decision.

### Effect on Students

All of this work is done to ensure that students face a fair hiring process in return for all the passion they put into joining a committee. Changes that will ease hiring nerves immediately include capping the number of interviewers to just the co-chairs of each club. In the Commerce Society, this means students will only have to face a maximum of 3 interviewers at once. I wholeheartedly supported this measure. While it is another workaround that co-chairs have to make and I am aware that co-chairs resent being controlled by the Commerce Society, I hope they can see the reasoning behind this measure.

Best of luck to the first year students that are completing interviews this year and I hope you experience a fair and fun frosh hiring!
