I flew halfway across the country to attend university, but instead of living in the school dorms, I decided to look around the area for comparable accommodations that come with better prices. I found a student housing co-op that asked almost half the price of living on the university residence, while being located in the prime area of the university district. I moved into this house a couple days ago.

I was walking through the campus yesterday when I noticed one of my new friends with a sour expression. On top of that, she had been sounding non-stop about attending the karaoke event, and she was a whole thirty minutes late. I don't know how, but the sleuth in me just *knew* something was up.

"What's wrong?"

"My roommate just moved out of our apartment. Now we have an empty room."

I wasn't too curious yet, but I didn't stop her. She proceeded to tell me that she was showing the room later that night to a couple of interested parties.  

"How much is it?" I simply wanted to get a feel for the situation, but then she said the magic words. She said that it was a hundred dollars less than what I was currently paying to live in a house. I gawked.

A thousand thoughts began running through my head. Hold on. I didn't exactly pay the fees in full to live in my room yet. That was happening tomorrow. She had really fast wifi in her room, while I could barely get a signal. Seriously a deciding factor. If I worked this out, I had to move out of my room by the next day because I'd be kicked out for not paying. I had 24 hours to find a bed, a desk, and a dresser. But the adrenaline of getting to pay so much less was a constant voice in my head telling me I needed this deal.

Then I heard myself say it. "I'd be interested."

I had a very short time window where I'd have to make a decision. After all, I had to move out by the next day. I was tempted to just make a rash decision on the spot, but I promised the few logical brain cells I possessed that I would see it first. My friend was alright with that, so we trekked our way north, weaving through several dark streets, until we arrived at her apartment.

On the way, she filled me in on the details of her lease. It was an 8 month lease by room, and the price included all utilities and better wifi. There was laundry in the basement, which was something I'd been living without for the past few days. I was getting so excited that I was beginning to envision myself living in the room. I hadn't even seen it yet. Even though I had absolutely no clue where I'd be getting furniture by *tomorrow*, I was convinced nothing could steer me away from this deal. I thought this would be my coming-of-age moment, signing my first lease.

But then things got weird.

The room itself was fine. Actually, it was better than fine. Our suite was located on the top floor of the apartment and it was newly renovated with the hardwood floors I was so familiar with. My room was also enormous, and it had two whole closets. I was pretty smitten. I was just hung up on the fact that it was located out of the university district.

Then I met the girl who was moving out. She explained to me that she was moving out because her friend had a place and she wanted to move in with her, but she couldn't get rid of the lease. She had to pay.

Red flag.

"So if I rent this room, do I give the money to you or directly to the landlord?"

"To me, to me," She enthused, unfazed. That was calming. It made me think that it would be a good idea to pay for somebody else's lease in that moment.

"Okay, so I pay you $500 per month?"

She looked horrified. "Oh, no. I pay $550 for it. That room is the biggest."

I'd been living the cash-strapped college student life thus far, and I'd been enjoying it. I wasn't about to give that up now. The prospect of paying $50 extra dollars per month is what snapped me awake. I nodded like a cool cucumber, and promised I'd be in touch.

As my friend and I left the building, she sounded alarmed. "I don't remember it being that much."

I told her that was a pretty substantial amount, and I then I wondered if paying her lease would be a smart move. As real adults know, it's not.

What ended up happening is that I contacted the landlord directly at 11:30PM and asked to clarify the price and the lease. He promised to give me a new lease and even offered me the price I really wanted. I still wanted it. It was so close.

But it was 11:30, and at that point in time I really wanted a bed to sleep on instead a pile of uncertainty for the next few days. Maybe I ended up making a rash decision, but I was tired.

"No, thank you."

That's how I ended up almost signing my first lease.
