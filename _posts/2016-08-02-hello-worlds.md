Here's another one. Hello, World!

With that, I finally join the leagues of infant bloggers that have successfully figured out how to beam their computer hacker messages onto the internet after a dizzying number of attempts. My head feels light, but I'm sure this is entirely due to the alarming amount of hair I've lost out of frustration. I've put this blog here to hopefully convince my mom that I am capable of doing things with my time despite my front of lying on a couch mindlessly consuming trashy media and to write to undemanding, imaginary friends instead of opening my anxiety-inducing inboxes. It's a perfect solution.

As I've been building this site, I've picked up on some bits of internet culture that remind me why so many flock to the extremely left-wing bubble society that is the internet to escape from real life. Once upon a time several years ago, I myself was an informed netizen and Tumblr memes were my religion. I gradually drifted from the clique, however, when I forgot my password. At the time, there were concepts that my young age prevented me from understanding so I thought people memed on Mitt Romney during his election cycle purely because he dropped a chicken wing at a barbecue one time. I see now the more pc reason for all the flak he got was because he was the current figurehead of capitalist values. He was the purveyor of the "irl" mentality that in order to be successful, you have to get paid for your work. That logic makes sense because humans need to eat to live, but like all the other rules it doesn't seem to apply to the internet. Here, it's the accepted norm to create things that people can use for free. Brilliant, busy people with lives to live instead dedicate their hours to make tools for others to use, and that's why we have Wikipedia and Kim Kardashian. Essentially, I want to thank all the smart samaritans that live on the internet forums where I copied all the complicated computer things needed to say hello to the world.
