"What's crack cocaine?"

We were on a train and one of the little girls in my field trip group had spotted somebody smoking a cigarette a few seats away. Obviously, it had jogged her memory and brought a passing subject she'd heard to light. At the time, I was their temporary legal guardian and I was told to be a responsible adult. I had my tongue primed give the typical responsible adult answer: "You'll know when you're older".

I knew they'd despise that answer, just as I did when I was young. But it's common sense that they can't get themselves into trouble if they don't know about something, right? If we don't teach them, it simply won't be a part of their world, right?

"Crack cocaine is a drug! But not a medicine type of drug, it's more like cigarettes. It's pretty bad for you."

"How do you take it?"

"Well, you can smoke it just like you smoke cigarettes. You roll it into a tube, light it on fire, and then you breathe in the smoke. Another way is by breathing it through your nose."

"Why?"

"People say it can get to your brain faster that way."

A large, burly man was squinting me down from across the narrow floor. Sitting beside him, a mother rocking her baby, month agape. I pretended not to notice them and soldiered on. I was having way too much fun imparting all the information I had ever learned about drugs to stop now.

"But why do people do it if it's not good for them?"

"Well, they get addicted. They don't really know why, but they can't stop using it and they always want more."

"I'm addicted to the TV," Another young boy, eavesdropping a little ways away had picked up on our conversation.

"I guess it's kind of like that. You keep on wanting to watch more, even if it might not be good for you."

I probably didn't get any society points for being a good babysitter that day as I was getting pretty murderous looks from passing strangers, but I was ecstatic. I've always been terrible with children because I never put the effort in to connect with them, but today, we reached an understanding through hard drugs. Today, I was lead to believe that innocent curiosity exists, free of malicious intent, and that children deserve a straight answer given with respect. It's the only way I got them to respect me in return.
