Uh-oh.

In the last couple of blog posts I did joke that I'd be MIA if something drastic actually happened to me, and that appears to be what happened here. I'm okay, unharmed.

I forgot to mention an incredibly important detail that made constant stream of blogging possible. We took travel bus and there was bus wifi the entire trip through.

Until I got to Montr√©al, that is.

Somehow it didn't really occur to me how much of a blessing I'd just been handed until I was thrown into a regular creaky white van for the rest of the trip. Some would say that's a good thing, though, because that's when I actually started taking my pictures seriously. Here's a shot of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls.

Did you know that the Niagara Falls are comprised of zero falls called Niagara Falls? I had never felt more scammed in my entire life. Canada owns one of the major falls, and American owns the other called American Falls. Here, the countries are separated only by a thin river and the cities on either side are both called Niagara. Because originality.

That was yesterday. Today, we rented a car after the tour group dropped us back off at the airport and we drove three hours into my university city, Kingston. I've been told all my life that Canada has too much land per capita, but I'd never gotten that impression because I lived in Vancouver my whole life, and things are packed pretty tightly together there. Here, if you wanna get to the supermarket you hop into car and you prepare for a three hour drive. It's big.

Kingston is particularly fun because of its constant allusions to royalty. Kingston used to be capital of Canada a long time ago, and it's where PM Sir John A. MacDonald hails from. He's a big deal here: There are main roads with his namesake and countless statues erected in his honour. Otherwise, the main streets are King St (The picturesque route through town), Princess St (Main street with serious old town vibes), and the large university is called Queen's. I've yet to find a Prince St, but I'm sure it's around.

I'm home now, or at least what will be home for the next year. My parents dropped me off at the front doors of my shared residence and for the first time in my life, I felt alone. I find it hard to believe that sending your kid away to study is such a common occurrence. It's so hard.

I'm not exactly living on residence: I'm living in student housing co-op. Co-ops are businesses where the customers actually own the business. Long story short, I paid a deposit to "own" this place, and every week I have to do mandatory kitchen service. Most of the people that live in this co-op are older than first-year, and that's obviously because it's easier to live alone if you already know everyone in the area. I did like the idea of trying to figure things out myself first year, so I took the plunge anyway and signed up.

And I dread to say this because the finality makes me want to get on a flight back to Vancouver, but I can only kid myself for so long. This old, penitentiary-laden town is home now.
