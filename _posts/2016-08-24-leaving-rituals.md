I'm leaving for university located across the country soon. I don't get pumped about this sort of thing easily, but so many people seem eager to get rid of me with their constant goodbyes that I'm starting to get swept away by their infectious excitement. I'm currently cocooned in a delicate bubble of bravado that makes me think I can survive without my parents for four months and that I'm ready to move out.

Assessing your life to take stock of everything you'll need to live for half a year is hard and depressing, so instead of doing that I've been Googling what you're supposed to do before you move out so you don't regret anything. The only thing I'm getting in return is generic trash that nobody wants to do like saying goodbye to friends and doing nice things for the family. Gross. It turns out that I'm going to have to write one myself based on real things I did to prepare. As an added bonus, to all those asking me how I've been spending my last few precious days at home, I proudly present my answer.

1. **Watch all the movies you're ashamed of liking.** I'm not going to be caught dead admitting that I like *Pride and Prejudice* at school. The only thing I have to face at home is my very irritated dad.

2. **Eat tacos with beans.** Beans are not an acceptable student communion living food. Neither are oysters, anchovies, tarantulas, and/or dog meat.

3. **Fight with the younger siblings.** You're not going to feel this much power in a house for a while, so you might as well savour it. Roll over their beds, eat all the ice cream, and use their bath towel. You can still get away with being an asshole.

4. **Change everything about your physical appearance.** Nobody is going to know if you looked better pre-transformation, so this is the best time in your life to see if you'd look good with a nose ring. Seriously. I'm getting a perm.

5. **Study feng shui.** I've never felt the need to hang decorative flourishes or posters on my walls before, but since it's on every packing list, it's probably essential.

6. **Hide from your problems.** oh my god i have to pay like my own taxes

Bless you. Good luck. And if you're a friend of mine: Bye!! See you soon! I'll miss you a lot!! Let's talk sometime!!!
