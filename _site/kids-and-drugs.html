           <p>“What’s crack cocaine?”</p>

<p>We were on a train and one of the little girls in my field trip group had spotted somebody smoking a cigarette a few seats away. Obviously, it had jogged her memory and brought a passing subject she’d heard to light. At the time, I was their temporary legal guardian and I was told to be a responsible adult. I had my tongue primed give the typical responsible adult answer: “You’ll know when you’re older”.</p>

<p>I knew they’d despise that answer, just as I did when I was young. But it’s common sense that they can’t get themselves into trouble if they don’t know about something, right? If we don’t teach them, it simply won’t be a part of their world, right?</p>

<p>“Crack cocaine is a drug! But not a medicine type of drug, it’s more like cigarettes. It’s pretty bad for you.”</p>

<p>“How do you take it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can smoke it just like you smoke cigarettes. You roll it into a tube, light it on fire, and then you breathe in the smoke. Another way is by breathing it through your nose.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“People say it can get to your brain faster that way.”</p>

<p>A large, burly man was squinting me down from across the narrow floor. Sitting beside him, a mother rocking her baby, mouth agape. I pretended not to notice them and soldiered on. I was having way too much fun imparting all the information I had ever learned about drugs to stop now.</p>

<p>“But why do people do it if it’s not good for them?”</p>

<p>“Well, they get addicted. They don’t really know why, but they can’t stop using it and they always want more.”</p>

<p>“I’m addicted to the TV,” Another young boy, eavesdropping a little ways away had picked up on our conversation.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s kind of like that. You keep on wanting to watch more, even if it might not be good for you.”</p>

<p>I probably didn’t get any society points for being a good babysitter that day as I was getting pretty murderous looks from passing strangers, but I was ecstatic. I’ve always been terrible with children because I never put the effort in to connect with them, but today, we reached an understanding through hard drugs. Today, I was lead to believe that innocent curiosity exists, free of malicious intent, and that children deserve a straight answer given with respect. It’s the only way I got them to respect me in return.</p>
