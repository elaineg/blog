I know you're dying to know what I've done with my life, so here's a quick list to bring you up to speed.

1. **Discovered and threw myself into a time portal.** Yes, I'm alive, and yes, I am a time traveller. Some local academics refer to the phenomenon as "midterm exams". Truthfully, time travel is a pretty draining experience and I lost thirty days of my life.

2. **Ordered fake cheese online.** I looked for a nice little gift to return my friend's thoughtful gesture of presenting me with a huge bulk bag of cookies and creme chocolate bites. I found the perfect item waiting on Amazon, as one does. It's called [nutritional yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast), and it sounds despicable. That'll teach people to be nice to me. Rest assured, I got it gift-wrapped.

3. **One end of my earbuds stopped working.** Audiobooks get a lot more interesting when you can't hear the words.

4. **Wore socks to bed.** Even worse, it's rapidly become a habit, and I have designated bed socks now. The weather has been briefly dipping into subzero numbers. It snowed last week, and I have come to realize that I am unable to function until I thaw my toes out in the morning. I know my old self from pre college days would be aghast at the monster I have become.

5. **Burned the roof of my mouth.** Kingston enters a pizza frenzy during half-off code season. It turns out that my fatal flaw is an inability to consume pizza without burning the roof of my mouth. The only thing I was able to consume for the previous week to avoid irritating all my mouth blisters was spinach. I'm perishing.

6. **Was stripped of my Asian superiority rights.** I like to think that I'm pretty damn good at using chopsticks, but I learned the distinction between what I want and the real world. I was challenged to a game where the objective was to transfer individual uncooked grains of rice from one bowl to another, and my opponents had never used chopsticks more technical than your average sushi takeout pairs. I'm never going to live down the shame of that day. I just hope my parents don't disown me.

7. **Almost switched majors.** I wish I was being funny about this, but I really did try and switch to computing before I had written my first midterms.

8. **Threw two surprise birthday parties.** I love the fundamental idea behind placing people in uncomfortable situations, and nothing is worse than having an almost complete stranger belt out an out of tune rendition of "Happy Birthday".

9. **Founded a startup.** We're trying to create a carpooling webapp. Will gladly take any name suggestions.

10. **Participated in the sharing economy.** I'm well aware that I have been feeding my brain far too much left media radio programs because my opinion of Uber placed them as the spawn of the devil. Verdict after my first free Uber ride? Nice driver, nice car. I'm torn. I wish my good friend and Uber driver all the best in the future.

11. **Dressed as Edward Scissorhands for Halloween on a complete whim.** Passerby consensus: "I think you're more of an Edward Safety Scissorhands".

And that concludes an extremely comprehensive report of my October. See you soon!!!
