I know better than anyone that orange is a difficult to deal with because I stubbornly insist on its complete integration into my personal projects. I've had to acquaint myself with its shortcomings as a color and unfortunately, this process didn't take very long. For one, it's impossible to place the colour next to a black object without my blog looking like a satan apologist forum. Nobody likes the iconically awful Halloween colour combo. Nobody likes orange.

I've struggled to like it my entire childhood. Orange is such an unwelcome intruder, the mom who wants to play truth or dare with you at a sleepover. You've never really considered it, and you don't really want to. It's got even less personality than yellow, which at least associates with happiness and sunshine, but has a poor public image anyway. The other day, I was considering the reasons why Team Instinct is the least popular Pokémon Go team by a landslide, and aside from the obvious reason that the name 'Instinct' is just an invitation to be bullied, the <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/gender-and-color/">internet</a> overwhelmingly claims that yellow and orange are the dingiest, most disliked colours. I can't help but notice they're similar in tone, mood, and expression: Think the shoddy yellow packaged No Name brands, neon orange emergency kit bags, ugly emojis. These two colors are cheap, alarming, and fake.

This was probably difficult to guess, but for some reason against my better judgement orange is how I identify as a person. By this admission, it's probably not difficult to also guess which loser Pokémon team I'm on. It's been a journey trying to figure out how this pitiful colour finds its place in a design sphere that is stacked so overwhelmingly against it. I hope this explains my affinity for the orange accents everywhere on the site, but if I'm lucky, you didn't even notice.
