I’ve done everything in my (limited frosh) power to sneak my way into the Alma Mater Society at Queen’s: I’ve conducted voodoo experiments on Assembly members (those who sit in during AMS decision making meetings) so that someone will fall sick and require my assistance as a proxy, creepily memorized the online profiles of the various directors and commissioners to be able to observe them from afar on campus, and even planted myself as volunteer in the Marketing and Communications office. Studying the student government has been my favourite form of involvement thus far, but I’ve had some inner conflict as I rethink my idea of effective governing leadership.

Student government at a university is such a different beast from what high school was like: a jillion times more bureaucratic, yet a jillion times more power. I’ve been deeply immersed in this functional but inefficient way of trying to improve the lives of all students at Queen’s.

Here’s a quick example of what I mean: Recently, one of our faculty was placed on academic probation because he gave his students the same mid-term exam that was used three years ago. In an open book exam. Many students had obtained that midterm from older students as exams are freely handed back for students to keep and had used it to study. An entire class received a 100% mark.  

To me, there really was nothing to say about this issue. Smith faculty are paid exorbitant salaries supposedly contingent on the deal that they provide a fair, high quality education to students. This should be reflected in the exams that they use to grade students: Using an old exam like this was simply inexcusable. The relaxed hand back nature of the exams coupled with the desperate competition among commerce students made it obviously inevitable that students would have access to the old midterms, so there’s no way faculty could argue that they were unaware that old exams would be circulated. My high school math teacher alone wrote a new test every three weeks or so: A group of faculty should be able to at least pull off just two new tests per semester.

Yet it was brought up to a discussion, and members of Assembly did everything  they could to consider the situation from both points of view. They really took an open-minded stance and gave the faculty the benefit of the doubt despite this inexcusable mishap. “We know it’s hard to write new exams,” or “We could have new handback system that makes it harder for students to distribute their exams,” were examples of comments that flew around the room. My tiny fixed brain could not even process these stances. I could only see that it was the faculty’s fault. Period.

Keeping an open mindset is a prerequisite for effective teamwork in any situation, but it’s not necessarily the most efficient thing. The AMS, with its countless child faculty society representatives, senators, board members, trustees, etc is likely similar to how a real governing house is run. You must spend a minimum of 40 minutes confirming the importance of, for example, sexual violence prevention training before any preliminary decision can be made.

This inclusive and thorough method of decision making is clearly more democratic and theoretically produces a more fitting outcome. However, I consider myself a pretty decisive person, and I value thinking quickly and acting immediately. That’s what I peg(ed) as effective leadership.

But considering the turn of recent events, I have seen for the first time why our governments have tried to shift away from this mentality for a long time. Recently, there seemed to be a widespread rejection of the inoffensive and unassertive way to reach decisions. It seemed people just wanted a leader that can get things done his way, and fast. But in the long term, I can see that P-E Trump’s closed mindedness is going to be a huge weakness for his country.

I guess diplomacy is a skill that is taught, not found among our natural tendencies. Neither is government. I was annoyed at the amount of time that was spent on seemingly common sense discussions, but that’s because it takes a degree of open mindedness that I clearly didn’t possess when I first got here. I had to realize that it’s not just unfair to operate with a closed mindset, but it can get dangerous. It’s the primal desire for assertive decision making that leads to the rise President Trumps.

So now, every time I sit in assembly I try and become a little more accustomed to the circlejerking.
