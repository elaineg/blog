I'm absolutely burnt out.

I just finished my second week of university and I already feel like I could pass out until humans go extinct. I was a religious non-coffee drinker and I preached the ability to function without it, but I've already fallen into the habit of forcibly injecting myself with caffeine until I manage to become even just mildly productive. I can't explain this lack of energy, either: I average around two hours of class per day, which is a far cry from the seven hours of school when I was at secondary school last year.

I probably spend the majority of energy on the wars fought by my conflicting thoughts. Anyone I've spoken to this week can attest to this. I tell people that I doubt my ability to compete in this challenging new space in the same breath that just promised that I'm holding my own. I tell people that I think a business degree might not be for me because it's hard and I don't get anything, forgetting that engineering and computer science students don't even have the time to be complaining on to an empty corner of cyberspace because their courseloads are so difficult. I had a different outlook every single hour of this week. One minute, I felt like Queen's was my homeland when someone complimented me on my favourite shirt, but the I'd feel like I had *completely* messed up my life coming here when I strode into a class and felt like a Martian the next. Part of what contributes to this constant self struggle is the fact that I know that I'm paying for every inch of this education. Is this *really* the best way to get my money's worth? Would it be worth more if I invested it elsewhere? It's not that I don't enjoy school just as much as I used to, but now there's a whole new aspect of self-motivation that completely changes the whole dynamic. I evaluate everything I do, see, and meet by asking myself if that experience was worth $100k. It's a horrible mindset, but one that is difficult to shake. It's plagued me all week.

But now it's Friday evening, and I'm starting to feel hopeful for the first time. I've dragged my battered body through all my classes and survived a near miss by missing my very first university assignment. I have been thoroughly judged by the countless (3) interviews that come with frosh hiring. At the same time, I have met people that will inspire me for years. I have talked to people that seem genuinely interested in talking to me. Hell, I've met actualy real people from *Sweden*. And when I think back to all the ridiculous, bizarre, and completely foreign experiences I've had, from almost renting a room (and to follow up on that: I am *so* glad I decided to stay right where I was) to setting an oven on fire while reheating taco shells (I was tempted to throw a bucket of water at it), there is nothing to question. I would give anything to live it all again.

Except $101k.

Regardless, I guess this revelation warrants a second beginning to this post.

Thanks mom. Thanks dad. I love it here. I'm tired, but that's because I use so much energy just to learn so much about my world everyday. I guess that's why babies spend all of their time sleeping: There is just *too* much information to absorb. I met a girl that comes from Chengdu, and she likes the same movies that I do. We debate on the cooler superhero from Marvel: I say Captain America, but she says the Winter Soldier. Deep down, it's no questions that she's right: Captain America is really lame. We also have other things in common: Her dad works for the Chinese customs, which I know is where dad used to work, too.

My homework is hard, but there is an entire faculty of teachers that are willing to help me. My interviews were hard, but my interviewers were really nice to me and I genuinely enjoyed them. I am so glad I didn't cancel the one interview with 60 other people competing because I thought I actually did pretty well. I didn't get the position, but I know I wasn't failure. I guess that's what I'm most afraid of, beyond anything. It's being a failure. Right now, I feel like the stakes are far too high for that. I can't afford to fall.

But just yesterday, a famous entrepreneur called Michele Romanow visited my school and gave a talk about her experiences with starting new companies. She said, "You'll always fall. There's no getting around it. You just have to get up, and keep going."

I guess that's what I'm gonna do. It'll be hard when I do fall to see that everything you've done for me was worth it, but I really have to start looking beyond that. I know that no matter what, I'm just gonna have to keep getting up. I hope that's enough to make you feel proud.
