The definition of being a team player that I have survived by so far is pulling your fair share of the weight, and taking initiative to get things done. I had no problem with both parts of this definition of teamwork: Since I would pass out from self-induced shame if I didn't complete my share of the groupwork, I always did my assigned parts on time and to the best of my ability. To also demonstrate how much of a great sport I was, I would assume the role of the breakroom booker for weekly meetings and send regular reminder notifications.

While these actions are conducive to great team performance, I am forcing myself to acknowledge the fact that they do not make me a well-rounded team player. My team members aren't going to feel like I care about them as human beings if I work solely off this definition.

Asking for help isn't something that comes naturally to me- Growing up, I was strictly taught to work hard and figure things out by myself because bothering other people is rude and inconsiderate. This has subtly translated to my behaviour in teams: The thought of asking my teammates for help to do my assigned work doesn't even occur to me. However, I know that I wouldn't be bothered if someone asked me for help- In fact, I'd probably feel more valued and that this group member cares about my input. I realize now that I can give off the impression that I am not willing to get to know my team members beyond the work they can contribute. This thought terrifies me because it couldn't be further from the truth.

This week, I'm going to force myself to speak with team members that I am too scared to even acknowledge outside of groupwork because I don't know anything about their personal selves. I think it goes without saying that just the thought of this exercise freezes my soul in fear- What if they're busy? What if I've already offended them with my lack of out-of-group interaction? It's okay. These are tiny problems in the grand scheme of things.
