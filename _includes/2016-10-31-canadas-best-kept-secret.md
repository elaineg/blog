*I started drafting this post on the first of October, but a time portal sucked me thirty days into the future. I don't want to linger on this major scientific breakthrough because the insignificant details of my life are a lot more important, but I believe scientists are calling this phenomenon "midterm exams". Take it or leave it.*

Kingston's claim to fame is that is built almost entirely out of limestone and history. Blended into the thick cement are the stories and lives of some who have played a big part in what our country's political and physical border situation looks like today. Sir John A. MacDonald's delicate features furnish every open clearing, while medieval artillery patrols the shores of the Ontario lake in a tight, orderly line.

There is no romanticizing the city. Most of Kingston is characterized by wrinkly, patchwork asphalt and vacant storefronts. It's brought to life by several hotspots that pump youthful energy through the rest of the sleepy municipality: The university district, the heart of downtown Kingston, and a shopping mall named Cataraqui Center. No, I don't know how to pronounce that. Hailing from a small suburb across the country, I figured that there was no way Kingston could be a downgrade. I was in for a treat.

Until I found Chris Hadfield's alma mater.

The Royal Military College has its own little peninsula, separated from the rest of the city by an underwhelming cast iron bridge. It's the southernmost part of Kingston, chosen strategically as the first line of defense against a horde of angry ex-Brits looking for more land.
