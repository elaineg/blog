           <p>Movies can be academic. At least, that’s the lie I tell myself in order to justify living a life completely composed of oxygen consumption. On the bright side, I live in an ideal set of circumstances to become a movie scholar. The movie preferences of my family members are perfect clichés. My dad keeps himself sane on unspeakably awful Asian warrior soaps and mindless spy films, while my mother only watches BBC’s most critically acclaimed rom coms (“My time is too precious!”). My tasteless self leans more toward the trash action genre, but I recently got baited to attend a surprise birthday on the premise we would be baking Jane Austen pastries. Actions speak louder than words, so while my dignity can’t admit to having an affinity for chick flicks, I know I’m certainly not kidding anyone.</p>

<p>I constantly make fun of both my parents for their taste in movies to smother my own preference insecurities, but I’m always around to watch what they have on. Today, my dad was feeling uncharacteristically social and for the first time I can remember, he invited me to watch a movie with him.</p>

<p>I was so down, I forgot to ask what he was planning to put on. In retrospect, that probably would have made no difference anyway. I would’ve just said “Anything’s fine!” but turn my nose up at any concrete choice presented. Besides, the opening credits were long over before I could string a coherent thought together.</p>

<p>For the next 99 minutes I watched a movie that was incredibly unoffensive given its subject matter about forcing a kidnapped girl into sex trafficking. But</p>

<p><img src="http://images.military.com/media/offduty/movies/taken2phone.jpg" alt="A portrait of Niam Leeson" title="Good man saves more than just his daughter" /></p>

<p>A team of brilliant people got together and tried to sell me the notion that this man is a hero that saves baby children, and I gotta say: they went above and beyond. He did more than save his kid: He is the savior of this movie. Niam Leeson, whose name looks like exactly the same thing if you reverse the first letters and spell Liam Neeson. Wait, which one IS it? You don’t know anymore. Anyway, he kicked butt so hard it grew up and became a trilogy of films. The <em>Taken</em> franchise appears to be the equivalent of Apple product releases: The exact same thing is released every year with a few minor tweaks. In <em>Taken 2</em>, the same kid is stolen, but there’s the gripping twist where his ex-wife gets stolen too. It’s an extremely inconsequential storyline, to the point where I cannot even remember the main character’s name. Only Niam Leeson.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I feel bad if I call this movie trash one more time because Leeson looked extremely sad the entire movie. I am now obliged to say it was a solid dad pick. At the very least, it’s a marked improvement over his old Chinese soaps because people have guns, which are handy catalysts to improve a sluggish, stale plot line.</p>
