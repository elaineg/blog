Well, not really.

Over the weekend I was dragged along on a family roadtrip that transported us to a small nobody town for an annual soccer tournament. I've been there twice before, each time to watch my brother compete.

"Watch" is actually a figure of speech in that sentence since I'm nowhere to be found when his games roll around. I could not care less, and I cannot be bothered to feel even a little guilty for being the world's least supportive sister. I scour TripAdvisor for any alternative to being a presence at my brother's games. To add to my shame, this tradition has yielded some interesting memories that you'll find me bragging about on a pretty frequent basis. One time, I found a rundown movie theatre that charges almost half the prices I paid back at home, so I spent an afternoon watching then-mega-hit *Guardians of the Galaxy*. Another, I relived a beloved internet meme called "How to get kicked out of Walmart" by doing somersaults in the aisles. I was a chicken, so obviously I did it when nobody was watching. Snapchat doesn't know that, though.

Evidently, I will do anything to avoid watching some sweaty meatballs barrel around in blistering heat in the name of celebrating sport. Or so I thought.

This year, I was feeling a lot less adventurous, and I really wanted to extort my parents for as much pity points as possible for bringing me along on this ridiculous annual ritual. As awful as that might sound, I've saved up enough points in the past to cash in for a free ice cream cone or a box of cherry strudels. I moped around our comfortably air conditioned hotel room and nibbled on the family's snack collection, constantly grating about the unlimited wifi being too slow or having too complicated a password to remember off the top of my head.

In between matches my family would come back to the hotel room and brace themselves for my incessant whining until the next game drew them out with the promise of salvation. At one point, my dad turned on the TV in a futile attempt to drown out my voice. It didn't make the slightest different, but that's when I found out that we had cable TV.

It made my vacation. The last time I remember having cable TV was during the Vancouver 2010 Games and since we never used it to watch anything else, I don't even remember when it disappeared from our house. The gift of cable TV reminded me that the Olympics were currently underway, and now I had a gateway to watch them.

From then on, I refused to be separated from the sweaty meatballs rolling around in blistering heat on screen. I suffered through century-long commercial breaks to watch a soccer match while my brother played in real life minutes away. Just to be clear, I didn't follow any sports prior and I don't intend to after. I have absolutely no interest in watching World or Regional Championships. Today, I come out and confess that I am the pinnacle of an Olympic bandwagoner.

Something about the premise of a sporting event presented on the largest international stage available crafts drama that cannot be found anywhere else. Your country's performance is personal, and people actually care which leads me to believe that Olympic  bandwagoners are more common than anyone would like to admit. With so much emotional investment, athletes are carefully scrutinized both in and out of competition.

And what they get up to is what I live for. In competition, historic repeats and upsets are equally as fun to watch. Everyone wants to see Usain Bolt win and it makes everyone's hour when he does. Everyone wants to watch Michael Phelps claim his 230950383th butterfly title and it breaks everyone's hour when he doesn't. Out of competition, the world makes villians of a new batch of people every day. Champion soccer player Hope Solo is a sore loser. The entire Russian team might as well rebrand as Team Galactic. The Olympics are a better *Keeping up with the Kardashians* because you don't feel guilty about wasting your precious minutes when you watch them. Instead, it feels more like conducting a science experiment to see what a mass congregation of humans can produce. Hint: A lot of fun times.

As a bandwagoner, what I'm most ashamed about is that the Olympic games made this year's family vacation the most enjoyable to date, and I didn't see my family much. To anyone considering a visit to BC's pride and joy Penticton, their best attraction is hotel cable TV.
