I think I just had my busiest weekend here. I was behind on all my readings and preparing for my first two major presentations-  I can confidently say that the weekend before my 5 consecutive midterm exams was cakewalk compared to this.

It doesn't help that I decided neglect facing my impending doom by signing up for the Queen's Marketing Association Conference instead. I'm excited at the prospect of meeting reps from the top brands in our country, but I mostly signed up because I just wanted to write the application. That sounds bizarre, but I swear it was written especially for me. They wanted a marketing campaign to convince them we were deserving of a spot. The QMA's colours are orange and teal, and they make it pretty clear that they want some homage to their home colours. Luckily, orange just about sums up everything that is near and dear to me. Make a campaign bragging about myself AND my favourite colour? My other priorities evaporated. I forgot just how much pain the long, cruel, and painful the web development and design process was and blindly ran headfirst into the carnage. If this is **TL;DR: [Click here](http://elainegao.com/qmac) to see my finished delegate application campaign.**

**Stage 1: Inspiration.** Decide on designing and writing a new website as your submission because that's the only trick you know, with the fun added bonus that it is the most inefficient project to complete. Leave your economics textbook for dust bunnies to burrow in and leaf through hundreds of pages of Google Fonts instead. I was looking for one that both channeled my personal style but was also reminiscent of the [QMA's](http://theqma.ca) title font. Was it excessive? Only if you're an amateur, unlike me. The typography deities are generous if you prove your devotion, and I was granted a gorgeous geometric sans that came with over 7 different weights.

**Stage 2: Validation.** First, map out the site's preliminary grid and mark where all the elements are going to go. Next, open Snapchat, take a photo, and get a nice unrelated filter on top of your pixellated computer screen (I have a special affinity for the speedometer). To caption, choose from one of the following options:
    1. "I SUCK AT DESIGN!!!"
    2. "OMG THIS IS SOOOOOOO UGLY SOS (:O)"
    3. "rofl"
Spend around 60% of your total project time here.

**Stage 3: Uncertainty and/or Repulsion.** Develop a deep, burning hatred for the absolute garbage your screen is trying to pass as your handiwork. Trash the file and start again. This step is crucial to the completion of all projects and cannot be skipped.

**Stage 4: Doomsday.** It's 1:30AM on a Sunday morning and you promised you'd have your presentation part written over 2 hours ago. Of course, you haven't started that, but you can't neglect this website now or it will consume all of your thoughts. You realize just how dangerous living life this far out on the edge actually is, and you suddenly find yourself in a strange state of calm. Nothing can touch you here. For the next 2 hours you are The Chosen One with superhuman focus and abilities.

**Stage 5: Bugs.** You think you're finished, but that's when you find a nasty insect crawling across your code. Catch it, and be presented with another one. And another one. Sit vigil over your code for another couple hours before forcibly shutting down your computer and vowing that you'll never open it again.

Considering that I maxed out on three hours of sleep last night and am no further along on my overwhelming homework load than I was Friday, I'm really hoping I don't make these sudden creative urges a habit. Then again, this blog post didn't write itself. Goddamn.

However, [let me know what you think](mailto:16eg1@queensu.ca) of the campaign or if you find any bugs yourself!
