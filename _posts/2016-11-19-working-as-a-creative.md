A highlight of university so far is being able to leverage my previously unrealized ability in graphic design to find volunteer opportunities around campus. Currently, I'm working as the graphic design deputy in the marketing office of the Alma Mater Society, which manages the government's brand and social media accounts. You feel pretty validated when your time devouring hobby that almost pulled your life apart eventually comes to serve a purpose.

Even though I got the chance to design for an actual brand, I was by no means experienced. The atmosphere of working on an art project for personal validation is worlds apart from having to meet other people's expectations. That's not news to me, but I definitely had to change the way I worked. These are the biggest differences:

**1. You have NO Time.** It's easier to lean on the side of being a perfectionist: You see a mistake in your work or something that you don't consider up to par and you tweak it. And then it just needs a little more tweaking. And hmm. Maybe a different colour because you're tired of staring at it now. Rinse, wash, and repeat. Understandably, at a certain point an employer no longer feels it's worth the money for more perfection.

My first creative project was to remake an old infographic. I wanted to prove myself to my employer, but I only had three hours to do it. For the record, I don't think I've ever designed ANYTHING in less than three hours. I told him I'd get it done in that time frame anyway.

Yeah. I didn't.

Time is definitely still one of my biggest challenges today, but I get so much practice that I'm really hoping I get speedier.

**2. Art? Forget about it.** I used to liken myself to a real artist whenever I designed anything. I'd find little ways to add symbolism or a message beyond just the surface of the photo. This was really for my personal enjoyment over catering to the basic needs of others, but I spent a great deal of time trying to be clever.

Not here. This is less design and more of me just being a graphics machine. There's a very real chance that I might end up hating my now commoditized hobby because I no longer do it for the reasons I used to enjoy it for, but right now I'm holding strong.

And it's not all bad. I still find ways to add a personal touch wherever I can that will definitely go unnoticed by others. An upcoming Christmas campaign will look like a candy cane when aligned in a grid:

**3. You'll get pushed out of your comfort zone.** When I started I was hit by a reality check in the form of a [brand guide](https://myams.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Updated-Visual-Identity-Standards.pdf "The AMS Visual Standards Guide"). I actually love the guide because it lays out the guidelines of color and logo placement instead of leaving it all up in the air, but for the first time I've been forced to use a serif font. Not a nice serif, like a slab, but Palatino Linotype. For one, it is spelled too similarly to Papyrus for my liking, and I have only ever used a similar font in design when showing people what kind of fonts you should avoid. It's a bittersweet feeling.

But beyond having to work with fonts and colours that I generally shy away from, I've also had to expand my horizons. I mass manufacture graphics and because I have a certain style, the threat that everything will end up looking the same is imminent. Working with new brushes, textures, and branching out from my love of flat design has been the biggest challenge of my work so far.

I'll continue to update you on what I'm working on! Until then, HAPPY EARLY CHRISTMAS!!!
