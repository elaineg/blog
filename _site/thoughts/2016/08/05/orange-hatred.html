           <h1>Nobody likes orange</h1>
           <header>
           <p>I know better than anyone that orange is a difficult to deal with because I stubbornly insist on its complete integration into my personal projects. I’ve had to acquaint myself with its shortcomings as a color and unfortunately, this process didn’t take very long. For one, it’s impossible to place the colour next to a black object without my blog looking like a satan apologist forum. Nobody likes the iconically awful Halloween colour combo. Nobody likes orange.</p>

<p>I’ve struggled to like it my entire childhood. Orange is such an unwelcome intruder, the mom who wants to play truth or dare with you at a sleepover. You’ve never really considered it, and you don’t really want to. It’s got even less personality than yellow, which at least associates with happiness and sunshine, but has a poor public image anyway. The other day, I was considering the reasons why Team Instinct is the least popular Pokémon Go team by a landslide, and aside from the obvious reason that the name ‘Instinct’ is just an invitation to be bullied, the <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/gender-and-color/">internet</a> overwhelmingly claims that yellow and orange are the dingiest, most disliked colours. I can’t help but notice they’re similar in tone, mood, and expression: Think the shoddy yellow packaged No Name brands, neon orange emergency kit bags, ugly emojis. These two colors are cheap, alarming, and fake.</p>

<p>I figure I don’t mind these connotations at all. I’ve grown to like orange a lot and I’m sure you can already guess which loser Pokémon team I’m on. I want to be a part of a movement to reinvent orange and make it look at passably hip. Considering my embarrassing record as a trend-stopper, I’m probably doing more harm for the colour than I am helping. Nonetheless, this explains my obvious affinity for orange accents on my blog, and I’ll bet you didn’t even notice.</p>
