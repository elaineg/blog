I used to have nightmares weeks leading up to airline travel. When I was younger, my brother always had a show called "Mayday" on, and it was a documentary-style account of all the noteworthy airline catastrophes that have ever happened in the history of ever.

I didn't have nightmares this time around. In fact, I couldn't even convince myself to think about leaving at all even up until the day I was slated to leave. I don't travel often, but this time around, flying was no more significant than boarding a bus. There was no fanfare playing as I left my childhood bedroom behind, with the carefully curated collection of Hello Kitties I'd been keeping since I was six. All the memories I thought I'd have to be pried from simply melted from my head, and watching the shining city of Vancouver disappear over a hill held almost no significance to me.

It's terrifying how fast we grow up, adapt, and move on. The concept of saying goodbye and leaving is a hard, but that's less of a real feeling and more of a romanticization. I *wanted* to be chock full of emotions as I left: A clear indication to everyone and myself that all these incredible memories I've garnered here really have meant something to me because lame words just don't seem to be able to do the scale of my parents' efforts justice. I wanted to reminisce about my childhood right before I relinquished it, but I had long forgotten how to be scared of flying.

Everyone knows I'm not happy about leaving, but I know it's going to be beneficial. I've become so comfortable getting raised by parents and babied by high school teachers that I think I'm nothing short of invincible. It's a really cool feeling, but I've come to realize that I *depend* upon this invincibility. What gets me out of bed every morning is having the support of everyone I know to do anything I want instead of being motivated by my own ideas. I'm used to getting things easy or at the very least having everyone value my opinion by default. I'm beginning to think that I live in a tiny world and there's basically nothing left for me to learn.

The only cure for invincibility is to take a one-way road straight out of your comfort zone. I didn't even have to travel very far before I started getting challenged again. On one of my flights en route to Toronto, I was lucky enough to be seated next to a natural born teacher with a burning passion for an enterprise of his own making. As I attempted to converse with him, it was apparent that I knew nothing about how the world worked. It's petty, but I've spent a lot of time feeling smart and it was almost painful to be completely schooled. Yet not only did I receive a university-grade lecture, I found myself being re-inspired by the same notions of creating the change I used to be cynical about. I felt like the fight to earn my voice was worth it again. It was the perfect kick to get me fired up for school because there was so much learning I had missed out on during a summer comprised simply of rewatching old movies. He spent every minute of his plane ride imparting as much wisdom as humanly possible from topics regarding evolving consumer demands and the increasing importance of sustainability in the world. I could not thank him enough.

That's in part why I think it's been so easy to say goodbye. I'm beyond fond of my childhood because there are no sad memories to cry over. I loved every experience and every person I met. With this stranger's reassurance that the future belongs to me just as much as it did when I had the immediate support of my parents, I've never been so ready to see what I've previously been scared of.

Bye, Vancouver. It was easy to say that, but don't doubt you were and therefore meant the world to me. I hope I make you proud.

*The stranger on the plane was the founder and CEO of a social network called [Sustainability TV](http://www.sustainabilitytelevision.com). Jason, thank you for your childlike passion to make the future a nicer place to be. I've made an account, and I'm loving all the stories of good for a change.*
