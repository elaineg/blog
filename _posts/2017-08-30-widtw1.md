With my second year starting, I'm too busy to take my parent's calls again. To prove that I'm not just avoiding them, this is what I'm doing this week. 

**Writing a competitor analysis for [QShare](https://elainegao.com/qshare).** I am QShare's product manager. My team and I have remotely conducted branding/identity sprints, established a working Facebook login and database, and written problem statements. 

**Designing posters and tickets for the [Sci'44 Co-op](http://studenthousingkingston.ca/) Welcome Cruise.** This is the student housing group where I live and to welcome new members, they've booked a 1000 Islands Cruise so everyone can get a chance to meet each other. 

**Studying valuation with NYU Stern Professor [Aswath Damodaran](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.ca/).** This prof was the first that made DCFs attainable to me. After spending an entire month nose deep in investment books but with no clue how to start stock picking, stumbling upon all this free material (he's put PDFs of his textbooks, all his lecture recordings, and class materials all on his personal website) was a real blessing.
