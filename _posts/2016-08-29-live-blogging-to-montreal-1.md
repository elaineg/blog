I have to apologize right off the bat for shoving extreme dosages of existentialism down your throat in all the previous posts. I don't usually use my brain that much and I normally I'm really funny. That was a joke. It was funny. Just take my word for it.

Traveling means staying in close proximity of other people for an extended period of time, naturally lending its way to being a real life game of survival of the fittest. Contestants battle to prove their physical and mental superiority by engaging in a number of everyday activities turned competitions. I don't get very many chances to stick it to my family, so I *have* to win.

We're embarking on a road trip from Toronto to Montréal for the next three days, which promises to cram a dizzying number of everyone's hours into a metal box on wheels. Day one brings on the grueling octathlon specifically comprised of

1. • Not succumbing to motion sickness
2. • Having a bladder larger than a pinhead
3. • Only resorting to "Are we there yet?" never
4. • Being on time
5. • Not being an asshole to the bus driver
6. • Laughing at the tour guide's jokes
7. • Not pressing snooze when your alarm rings at 5:30 in the morning
8. • Eating all your food at mealtimes instead of just four bites and claiming you're super full when everyone knows that twenty minutes down the road you'll be complaining about how starving you are.


Road trips are my absolute weakness so I have to go in with a viable game plan. The night before a 5:30AM wake-up call, I stay up until 2AM (11PM PST) to ensure I get as little sleep as possible. Ideally, I'm aiming high and hoping that I'll be out cold for the duration of the trip, giving me an automatic pass on all of the day's events. Sleeping people don't tend to throw up.

Any good strategist also has a back up plan. To supplement or maximize all the possible sleeping time I can get, I pack two paperbacks written by smart people I don't understand. I download all the French podcasts CBC has to offer. I create a Spotify playlist and call it "KO", because if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna kill it ultimate street fighter style. There's only one song on it: Careless Whisper, which I'm just going to blast on repeat so the only refuge my brain can find is falling asleep. It's foolproof.

I'm about to head to bed now. It's 2:14AM. Tomorrow, the games begin. May the best contestant (me) win.

**5:30AM** I wake up to the sound of at least four alarms, which is my own doing. The previous night I conducted a quick scavenger hunt around the room and instructed all the clocks I could find to wake me up on time. The cacophony of unadulterated screeches mix so badly that it's almost harmonious. I'm nearly lulled back to sleep, but I steel myself and wiggle out from my comforter cocoon. My dad hit snooze and my mom's already muttering that she's beyond the rules. I win.

**6:05AM** Breakfast boxes are brought up to our room. It's bare bones fare: An ice cube disguised as a Granny Smith apple, a rock solid croissant, a cup of water branded "Fat-free Activia Yogurt", and a blueberry muffin no doubt made of equal parts sticky tack and peanut butter. In a moment of weakness, the effort required to peel the muffin off the walls of my mouth after every bite is not worth the title. I don't finish my breakfast, but I'm sure I won't need to eat until lunchtime. A minor setback.

well ok

**8:00AM** In a devastating turn of events, I learned that my plan was, indeed, not foolproof. I had not foreseen a glaring detail: Bus wifi. A teen does not sleep when they have access to high speed internet. I watch my crown melt off my head in the form of Viserys getting his gold crown. Yeah, I'm rewatching *Game of Thrones*, and obliterating my perfect plan.

**8:17AM** A little boy throws up within the first twenty minutes of our bus ride. I feel an immeasurable amount of triumph knowing that I've conquered a five-year old. Morale is high, even though it comes with a pretty bad smell.

**9:24AM** SOS. I am. starving. Cannot think straight because of my howling bowel. My fingeuers are gradually losing dextrerity cannot type must have sustaenance help

I may nto make it. Hopefully you'll get to see an uipddate soon. if not... please send crisis reflief in form of gummy worms and choclotate.

**Heures à Montréal:** 4
