*This is the second installment of my live blogging to Montréal series. For the first post, click [here.](http://www.elainegao.com/blog/live-blogging-to-montreal-1)*

**11AM** Yes, I made it.

I was on the edge of passing out from starvation because if you remember from the previous post, I didn't really eat most of my breakfast. I also didn't bring any snacks, because snacks are for the losers of The Travel Games. I was drifting in and out of consciousness, in between smooth jazz snippets courtesy of Careless Whisper layered by varying levels of abdominal pain.

It was going to take some kind of Christmas miracle to revive me, because obviously I couldn't have food. As you'd probably guess, that's exactly what happened. As Careless Whisper drew to a close with a few seconds of solitude before Careless Whisper would begin playing again, I heard my brother mutter, "How much longer until we get there?" from beyond my earbuds.

That satiated my appetite for winning, and if your entire being is dedicated to first place, there is no difference between your food appetite and your competitive one. For the time being, I rode on a wave of accomplishment.

And I mean that literally. Somewhere along this timeline, my tour group had boarded a boat cruise and we were now gliding over the waters of Lake Ontario. We were visiting a popular tourist destination called mill ills, or if you're offended by that, "Mille-Îles". The people that spoke English also had a tendency to refer to the attraction as the 1000 Islands, but my life philosophy has always been to go big or go home. Why play it safe?

It's difficult to understand the scale of Lake Ontario, but the fact that there are around 1,800 islands in a small part of the lake really helps put things in perspective. I thought it was just a catchy but exaggerated name, but once I learned that the smallest islands are no more than a few meters wide, I could begin to believe the staggering numbers. This is one such island.

A well-known fact is that my dad is a tech genius. He just gets it and knows how to make things work, no matter how complicated it is. It's his job. So when I asked him to take some tourist photos of me for you to enjoy using an iPhone, arguably the world's most accessible piece of technology, it goes without saying that he killed it.

That is one wild adventure down. I'm not sure how many more trials I stand, but wish me luck.

**Heures à Montréal:** 2.5
